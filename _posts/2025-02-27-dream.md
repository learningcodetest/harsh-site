I don’t remember much of what happened.

But I was in a room with a few others.

I was already distressed, quite visibly. Something from the previous dream had carried over, but I no longer remembered what it was.

The distress was so vivid, it felt like impending doom. The room was filled with people who did not really care about the doom. Or they did not notice that I was worrying.

In real life, my unconscious body kept feeling like it was falling— a never-ending sensation of having no supporting surface beneath me.

In the room, I looked everywhere and then up at the sky. I could see the sky from within the room by looking at the ceiling. But the room was a closed box.

The sky was unusually clear, with bright stars. There was a faint, dark-maroon-brown tint to it. Or maybe space was in full view.

There were clusters of stars—very bright. There were planets too, quite distinguishable, like in picture books.

I started noticing the distinct shapes and colors of the planets. Mars was visible—a tiny ball, but larger than what we usually see.

Jupiter was tiny. Then I saw Saturn. I could see the ring around it. It was red.

My gaze moved further away, and I saw another Saturn. This one was larger than the first Saturn. Something made my hands shiver. I looked to the right and saw two large Saturns. Both were brownish and covered almost half of the sky. They had enormous rings around them.

My heart sank.

This was the impending doom, I thought.

I panicked.

Suddenly, I felt that gravity had shifted its orientation. Everyone in the room got pulled toward one wall. Then the room started spinning the other way, and all of us fell onto the opposite wall. This process kept repeating.

I tried finding window grilles to hold on to, but when I grabbed one, the window broke off from the wall.

This was not a natural disaster but a spatial one, I thought.

Now, the hole in the wall was above me. It seemed like when the room turned again, I would fall through it.

The room started spinning. I lost my grip.
And the second I was about to be sucked out into space—

I woke up.
